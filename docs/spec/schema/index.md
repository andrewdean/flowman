# Schemas

Flowman uses schema definitions at various places, most commonly where relations (data sources and sinks)
are defined. Flowman does not only support inline schema definitions, but also supports various external schema 
definitions like Avro, Swagger and JSON Schema.


## Schema Types
```eval_rst
