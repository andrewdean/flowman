# Flowman Jobs

In addition to a completely data centric data flow specification, Flowman also supports so 
called *jobs*, which include specific *tasks* to be executed. A task simply is an action which
is executed, similar to a (simple) batch file.

Common tasks is the execution of one or more data flows via output tasks, data copy or 
upload tasks or simply printing some information onto the console.
