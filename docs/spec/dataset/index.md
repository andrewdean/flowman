# Datasets

Similar to [schemas](../schema/index.md), datasets in Flowman are not primary entities but used at various places
to abstract from specific implementations (like files, Hive tables or even mappings). Depending on the specific kind
the dataset abstraction can support reading and/or writing data.

## Dataset Types
```eval_rst
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :glob:

   *
```
